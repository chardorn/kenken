##MAIN:

# The 6x6 calcudoku is a similar constraint satisfaction problem as it 
# also has constraints for which an evaluation function can be applied. A 
# state for the calcudoku grid is an assignment of numbers 1 to 6 to each 
# of the 6 rows as seen in figure 4. The evaluation function calculates the 
# cost by calculating the number of duplicates in each column and adding it 
# to the cost. For each cage, the result of the numbers is calculated and 
# compared to the result the cage should have. The difference is then added 
# to the cost. For example, the first column in figure 4 has 2 duplicates, 
# this cost of 2 will be added to the total cost for that grid. The top left 
# cage in figure 4 shows a multiplication operator and a result of 24. The 
# result of the numbers entered within this cage is equal to 10, this is a 
# difference of 14. This also will be added to the total cost of the grid. 
# The neighboring search space of a state is the collection of switches 
# between two numbers within a row. Thus, the hill climbing algorithm 
# calculates the cost of each possible switch within the rows. If the cost 
# of the lowest scoring neighboring state is lower than the current state 
# cost, then the calcudoku grid is updated. Similar to the 8-queensâ€™ problem, 
# the algorithm iteratively computes this step until the cost is zero or no 
# better moves are possible.
